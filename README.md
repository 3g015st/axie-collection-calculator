# Axie Collection Calculator

> The problem is that I wanted to know the estimated amount of my axie collection every month. But I don't have the time to check every axie's floor price over the marketplace. So I decided to do some automation lol.

> The application must send me a spreadsheet through Google Drive, every end of the month with this kind of format.

> The spreadsheet must be divided into two sheets. Axie ID must be a clickable link that directs to the Axie Marketplace that contains axies that are similar to the Axie ID that will be clicked.
